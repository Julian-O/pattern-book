or visit
the [*Madison Area Jugglers website*](http://madjugglers.com) for other links to this document and cool stuff about the MAJ.  All the code to make (and update!) this collection is at a [*Github repository*](https://github.com/wiscstatman/pattern-book). See the *build* subdirectory for the current pdf file.  Thinking it would facilitate
expansion and easy inclusion of new patterns, we formed the source code for this document as a collection of simple markdown files, including image media as appropriate.  New contributions are welcome for the next version, so 
please visit the Github site and provide some pattern descriptions.

Where possible we have given  credit to the creators of the patterns described here, though for many
these origins were unknown to us.  If we have erred in our attributions, please let us know.

## What's New in Version 3.1

Let's not talk about the mistakes and omissions 
in previous versions, many of which have been repaired in the present document.  We have added a bunch of new patterns (e.g., laxatives, the pollinator, the zigzag, sneaky-snake, that's-a-really-good-one, fully-loaded-blast, Mel's-dream, and more).  We added more on big patterns, including on the super-fun 24-person hex-of-clovers.  
 At recent practices we've experimented a lot with <i> colors</i>, in which jugglers each start with a distinct set of clubs, 
and we see how long it takes to move the colors around.  This version has some details on the substructure of a few of our cool patterns.    

Thanks to Jeff Adamus for posting YouTube recordings of a bunch of our patterns; we've
added links *where* (Thanks to Jeremy, Jessie, and ? others for great camera work!) . *other animations?*  On formatting,  we've moved to 12pt font to reduce eye strain!  Like all earlier versions, the current Version \majpatternbookversion&nbsp;contains mistakes and unfortunate omissions, which we have yet to discover and
 for which the Editor's take responsibility.   We hope
that  future versions will correct these shortcomings.
