It's trickier than you might think, even if you rock double 3 count.

As you've seen, there are a mind boggling variety of possible weaves. Well, any of these weaves can be paired up with any other weave to make a double weave. The permutations are infinite, but here are some that we like.

**Standard Double Weave**

If A, B and C do a standard weave and pass across to D, E and F in a standard weave, you get the Standard Double Weave.

|             |       |       |       |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** |
| **A**       | D     |       |       |
| **B**       |       | E     |       |
| **C**       |       |       | F     |
| **D**       | A     |       |       |
| **E**       |       | B     |       |
| **F**       |       |       | C     |

Right hand counting

The standard weave has each juggler moving forward in the middle, and back on the ends. Move to the next position after each pass. See the Standard Weave for more details concerning movement.

In this version jugglers pass short throws in the middle and long throws on the ends. As always, watch the lead throws!

**Invert Prevert Weave (Equidistant Weave)**

One team is inverted (which must mean the other team is preverted). Team DEF does an inverted weave by moving forward on the ends and backwards in the middle. This is an easier weave than the standard weave if all passers are comfortable with both standard and inverted weaves and looks nice because each juggler in a pair stays the same distance from the other.

![](./media/image69.png) **(Kitty-Korner Weave)**

Same as the standard weave, but pass to the opposite corner on the ends.

**Dresser Drawers Double Weave**

Both teams do the Dresser Drawers weave.

![](./media/image70.png)

All passes are right hand doubles (like 7 2-count). Each weaver passes to only one other weaver (like in standard double weave) in a 6-count. The leads are very important.

|             |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
| **A**       | D-D   |       |       |       |       |       |
| **B**       |       |       | D-E   |       |       |       |
| **C**       |       |       |       |       | D-F   |       |
| **D**       |       | D-B   |       |       |       |       |
| **E**       |       |       |       | D-C   |       |       |
| **F**       |       |       |       |       |       | D-A   |

Both hands counting

A, B and C start with right hand

D, E and F start with left hand

**Switch Sides Double Weave**

Switch sides at each end. For example, after A and D pass at the end, they switch positions so that A, E, and F are weaving, as are D, B, and C.

When was this pattern created? We have been doing it since 1993?

### Double Gandini Weave

The Standard Gandini Weave makes a very nice double weave too. Each weaver passes twice in a row to two different jugglers, and then has 4 selves to move out, around back and into the middle. Next time move out in the opposite direction.

|             |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
| **A**       |       |       |       | E     | F     |       |
| **B**       |       | D     | E     |       |       |       |
| **C**       | D     |       |       |       |       | F     |
| **D**       | C     | B     |       |       |       |       |
| **E**       |       |       | B     | A     |       |       |
| **F**       |       |       |       |       | A     | C     |

For a good time, call Melonhead. Or try this pattern in chocolate bar.

Another nice variation is to add an extra club and make all the passes in the middle right hand doubles.

Based on Gandini Weaves by Gandini Juggling Project and MAJ.

### Double Gandini Weave Plus

There is so much time at the back end of the Double Gandini Weave! Nine self throws! There must be something to do in all that time. Wait, I know! Let's add another club!

This is the same as the previous pattern with a triple club passed back and forth over the top of the pattern. It's a spectacular pattern and not as hard as you might think (though certainly not easy).

### Stick on the End Double Weave (Synchronous)

Two teams of weavers pass to each other while weaving: moving back on the ends, forward in the middle. Pass straight across from whatever position you are in. "Synchronous" means everyone passes at the same time. In order for this to work, pass twice while in the end positions, and pass once while in the middle. Weavers pass in 6-count.

In the graph below, lines indicate passes, numbers indicate the passing beat, and arrows indicate movement after the pass.

Note: If each side moves on the edges and middle of a rectangle, instead of weaving, we have the essence of Han's Delight. \[Euro '98'\].

Right hand counting Fast Spiral Weave

3-Count Standard Spiral Weave

double 3 Count Hyper-Spiral Weave

Refer to the graph above to follow A's path through the pattern. A's first pass is to E. A then turns around and moves to the bottom of loop 1 where a pass is made to F. A turns and moves to the top of loop 1 to pass to E. A turns and moves to the bottom of loop 2 to pass to F. A turns and moves to to the top of loop 3 to pass to E. A turns and moves to the bottom of loop 3 to pass to F. A turns and moves to the top of loop 2 where the pattern started.

Jugglers A, B, C, and D all do the same thing on pass out of phase. If the numbers show right hand counting this is the Fast Spiral and the weavers have a 4-count to move between each position. This is very fast.

To slow the pattern to 3-count, change the column numbers in the table above from 1, 2, 3, 4 to 1, 4, 7, and 10, and change "Right hand counting" to "Both hands counting, right hand starts". The weavers will pass in 6-count (note that 2 weavers, A and C are passing left handed 6-count).

Still too fast? Change the column numbers to 1, 3, 5, and 7 with right hand counting (weavers in 8-count).

Like many patterns, Spirals can be stacked, where one of the feeders is replaced another Spiral with the original feeder moved to the other side of the additional Spiral.

To red line this pattern have the feeders throw double 3 count, but keep the same passing order. Now the weavers are all in 3-count. The Hyper Spiral should be enough to challenge the most jaded of weavers!

Quick poll. Does this look like a spiral to you? Us either.

###
![](./media/image76.jpeg)

The standard weave for 1 feeder and 5 feedees has each feedee in 10-count (every 5<sup>th</sup> right) and the feeder in 2-count. Each weaver passes once on the end, moves backwards and inside, then passes once in the middle, and moves forwards and outside to the other end. A 10-count sound very slow, but I think you'll find most weavers will not be bored at all trying to keep up.

Once it starts, it's pretty easy to keep going. The start is a bit different from the standard weave for 3. The first weaver who passes in the middle goes to the opposite side of the first outside pass.

A – B end (B goes back on the end)

A – C middle (C move slowly forward and to their right)

A – D end (D goes back on the end)

A – E middle (E moves forward and to their left)

A – F end (F moves slowly left before the pass, then back on the end)

A next passes to B in the middle (as B is moving to their right) and continues passing to each weaver in order, but in the next weave position.

All of the weave variations can be done in a 5 Weave too. For added fun and excitement try a double weave of 2 standard 5 weaves, or 5 weave opposite a 3 weave, or a 5 weave opposite a Gandini Weave and so on.

Also see Twister 5 variations.

### Gandini 5 Weave

![](./media/image77.jpeg)

In this weave all the weavers move in a figure 8, but they always pass from the middle instead of the end.

The feeder is in 2-count (every right hand pass), the feedees are in 10-count.

![](./media/image78.jpeg)

It's easiest to start with the weavers stacked in a line all facing the feeder. Then each weaver will pass once and move in the opposite direction of the weaver in front of them.

Try all the same variations for the Standard Weave and Gandini Weave, and alternate counts such as 2 of 3 count. You can also invert the weave (reverse cascade). Also see Appendix C.

We learned about this family of weave variations from juggling with Sean Gandini and the Gandini Juggling Project in 2000.

### Twister 4 Weave

Twister Weaves can be done with any number of jugglers. Here's a twister weave for 6.

### Interlocking Turbos

The Turbo pattern for 3 jugglers lends itself to lots of variations. This is a pattern of 2 Turbos side by side where during each transition the weaver moves from one of the Turbos to the other.

Three of the jugglers always do an “inside turn” (turning towards their right hand pass). Three of the jugglers do an “outside turn” (turning away from the right hand pass). A, B and C will always go on the outside when they cross with the other Turbo. D, E and F always go on the inside.

The standard pattern is in a 2-count Turbo. You can do it in 4-count or 3-count to slow it down.

Try in Tom's Turbo for a good challenge. The Interlocking Extra Club Turbos is a formidable challenge for the those with time, talent and hubris.

Pattern by Luke Emery, 1999.

### Back to Back Turbos

Two Turbos are back-to-back. There are 2 situations concerning the switching of sides. When you are on one side of a turbo, you weave as you would in the regular turbo. In box 2, B and E switch sides in regular turbo style. When you are on the other side of the turbo, you move to the other turbo. In box 5, A and F switch turbos.

The movement arrows in the graph below are an approximation. In other words, you should move as soon as you can.

Lines indicate passes, and arrows indicate movement.

A, B, C, and D are doing a Feast (in 4-count), but the self throw is replaced with a pass to one of the movers in the middle. A, B, C, and D are passing 4-count. E and F are passing 8-count.

Here's another MAJ standard. E and F are carriage return feeders, feeding to 3 positions: left, middle, right, left, middle, right, etc. The rest of the jugglers move around in a ring, passing to the feeders. They pass 3 times to each feeder and then turn around to pass 3 times to the next feeder.

Right hand counting

Lets look to see what B does. B passes to E on the first beat and then has one right hand self to turn around and make the first pass to F. Then B moves to the middle (to where C is in the graph above). After B passes to F (beat 5 in the above table), B moves to where D is in the graph above. B makes one more pass to F before turning around to repeat the 3-pass cycle with E.

A, B, C, and D pass every other right hand. E and F pass every right hand.

**Benzene Ring Plus**

A challenging variation is to add two clubs to the pattern so that E and F do a 2-count extra club typewriter feed. All passes are doubles.

**7 Club 3-count Hex**

For those seeking a challenge, try a Hex where each pair juggles a 3-count 7 club pattern in doubles. It works if the passes are precise.

Pattern by MAJ.

###
![](./media/image86.png)

The Bubbler is a Star of David with interlocking triangles and extra clubs in 4-count doubles (that's the effervescent part).

A, C and D are in one triangle. They do a 4-count extra club triangle. The pass is a double from right hand to left hand. Each juggler passes to the juggler on their left The timing is a little fast and syncopated (A throws to C, C throws to D 4/3 beats after A, D throws to A 4/3 beats after C).

B, F and E are another triangle. They do a 4-count extra club triangle too. F throws at exactly the same time as A, E throws with C and D is synchronized with B.

Get that pattern smooth first. Now, notice how the juggler across from you is doing a self at the exact same time as you are? Now, just pass the right hand single straight across.

As always, timing is the key.

This pattern doesn't lend itself to a table format because the counts aren't even, but it's easy to figure out.

### Double Handled Egg Beater

I can't imagine why you would want an egg beater with 2 handlers, but if you did, and it was made of weaving jugglers, it might look like this.

### Trompe L'oeil (Concentric Triangles)

Here's an extension of the 4-count extra club triangle to 6 jugglers. All the jugglers should be quite comfortable with 4-count extra club triangles.

A – Double to F, self

D – Double to C, self

C – Double to E, self

F – Double to B, self

B – Double to D, self

E – Double to A, self

All passes right handed. 2 extra clubs (A , and D start with 4).

This is the 4-count version.

There are also nice variations in 6 count doubles (with 1 extra club), 7 club 3-count (2 extra clubs and same pattern a 4-count, just slower), 2-count doubles (3 extra clubs - A, B and C all start with 4), and if you're feeling crazy, chocolate bar (PPSSSS) or 1 – count (2 extra clubs and 6 extra clubs respectively).

This is an extension of a pattern Matt learned at a juggling convention where the same formation juggles without extra clubs in whatever count they choose (4-count being standard).

### Fireworks

Do you have nerves of steel? Do you juggle with poise and confidence while bombs explode all around you and other jugglers panic and dive for cover? Good, you'll need all of that for this pattern. It is a right handed pattern with 4 extra clubs and lots of doubles and triples. Sometimes, (maybe even often, for some jugglers), those collide above your heads.

However, if thrown carefully, there is just enough room for all of them.
