#  8 Person Patterns

## Naturals

Various patterns for other numbers of jugglers are naturally modified to 8, such as:

### Feast

### 4-on-4 line

### Double vision

  Take any (almost any) 4 person pattern and turn each juggler into two.  Double-vision boxes are 
   nice and fun; The double-vision oogle boogie is possible too.  Someone should try a double-vision
   shooting star, but we haven't yet!

### Big Hinge minus 4

  Drop all 4 baby positions from this 12 person pattern.


## Polymer Weave

It's a passing axiom that any 2-count feeder can be replaced by a standard weave. If this
is applied to the traditional W pattern, the result is this crazy pattern. It is
called a Polymer Weave because you can add additional weaves to either end of
the pattern (just like adding additional passers to a W).

## Benzene Ring (for 8 Jugglers)

Here's another MAJ standard. E and F are carriage return feeders, feeding to 3
positions: left, middle, right, left, middle, right, etc. The rest of the
jugglers move around in a ring, passing to the feeders. They pass 3 times to
each feeder and then turn around to pass 3 times to the next feeder.

| positions                                       |    Right-hand counting |


The feeders G and H feed carriage return to 4 positions (instead of 3 positions
in the 6 juggler version). The movers move around the loop passing to each
feeder 4 times before turning around to pass to the other feeder. The graph
shows half of a full cycle. The pattern will repeat in its mirror image.

Variations:  

### Inverted extra club Benzene Ring. 

A very cool variation of the Benzene Ring is to invert the movers, so they are all facing
 inward instead of outward on the elliptical path.   They can't pass to the same feeder (unless by back drop),
so they pass doubles over the opposing line and toward the opposite-side feeder.   So it's a two-extra
club pattern: double-throw then shift over on 6-count, repeat for four spots, then turn 180 and repeat. Careful about collisions!  Usually feeders start with the extra clubs.
  To make it more fun the movers can do 3-count, by adding a single pass to their counterpart inside the ellipse!
These are are lefts that are themselves 6 count; so together the movers do 3-count, alternating single inside pass double pass over the line.

### Wonky Benzene Ring.  

Instead of 4 spots on each side and all passing 6 count **Peter, how does this work?**

## Khaos Butterfly
![](./media/image111.jpeg){width=50%}

 Kat's Khaos Butterfly is two standard feeds back to back. After each sweep of
the feed, each juggler moves to the next position.

Solid lines are movement, dotted lines are passes.
