    1.  ### Polymer Weave

It's a passing axiom that any 2-count feeder can be replaced by a weave. If this is applied to the traditional W pattern, the result is this crazy pattern. It is called a Polymer Weave because you can add additional weaves to either end of the pattern (just like adding additional passers to a W).

Here's another MAJ standard. E and F are carriage return feeders, feeding to 3 positions: left, middle, right, left, middle, right, etc. The rest of the jugglers move around in a ring, passing to the feeders. They pass 3 times to each feeder and then turn around to pass 3 times to the next feeder.

Right hand counting

The feeders G and H feed carriage return to 4 positions (instead of 3 positions in the 6 juggler version). The movers move around the loop passing to each feeder 4 times before turning around to pass to the other feeder. The graph shows half of a full cycle. The pattern will repeat in its mirror image.

Kat's Khaos Butterfly is two standard feeds back to back. After each sweep of the feed, each juggler moves to the next position.

Solid lines are movement, dotted lines are passes.

    1.  ### Twister Sandwich

This is a difficult pattern.

|             |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|

| **I**       | F     |       |       | D     |       |       |

Right hand counting

D, E, and F are doing the Double-time Twister Weave. The single feeders on the opposite sides of D, E, and F have been replaced with 3 weavers on one side and 3 weavers on the other side.

A, B, and C (and G,H, and I) are doing a standard weave; passing to D,E, and F.

To help you remember to whom you are supposed to pass, just pass straight across from whatever position that you are in. For example, C is in the right side, so when C passes, he or she will pass to who ever is in the right position at that time (in this case, C's first pass is to F). C will then move to the middle and pass to who ever is in the middle.

Variations: (1) Replace either standard weave with one standard feeder or two every-other feeders. If there is one feeder, they are known as the Olive and the sandwich is an Open Faced Sandwich.

(2) After one cycle, rotate the weaves by 90 degrees. For example, after one cycle the positions will be as indicated in the graph above. Run the next cycle with C, F, and I as one standard weave, B, E, and H as the double-time twister weave, and A,D, and G as a standard weave. This version is insane to implement, but it does provide intellectual stimulation.

(3) Add another "slice" to the sandwich: add jugglers J, K, and L below G, H, and I. G, H, and I are also doing the Double-time Twister. This is the Double Decker Sandwich.

(4) If the outside weavers are having trouble keeping up, then you can change any of the weaves to fixed positions where the ends pass in 8-count and the insides pass in 4-count. This is known as Stale Bread.

![](./media/image113.png)

This pattern is a cross between the Asynchronous Double Weave and the Canoe. The Canoe for 3 jugglers is commonly referred to as a drop-back line. We recommend that you can do these before trying the Weaving Canoes.

|             |       |       |       |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** |
| **A**       | D     |       |       |
| **B**       |       | E     |       |
| **C**       |       |       | F     |
| **D**       | G     |       |       |
| **E**       |       | H     |       |
| **F**       |       |       | I     |
| **G**       | A     |       |       |
| **H**       |       | B     |       |
| **I**       |       |       | C     |

Right hand counting

A, B, and C face downward. The rest face upward. Weavers are in rows. Canoes are in columns. D, E, and F pass drop-backs.

A, D, and G start the pattern with the first pass as indicated in the passing graph above. After they pass, they move to the right of their respective weaves. Meanwhile, B, E, and H make their first pass on the second passing beat, and then weave to the left, replacing A, D, and G. C, F, and I pass on the 3rd passing beat and weave to the left.

Variation: Have one of the weaving teams remain stationary.

Pattern dates to September, 1999 by Peter Kaseman.

### Double Gandini 5 Weave

Two mirrored Gandini 5 Weaves face each other and pass in 2-count (or any other count).

Weavers go in alternate directions. It is easiest if both weavers go the same direction (for example A and F start to the pattern's right and B and G start to the pattern's left).
