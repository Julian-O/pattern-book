## Simple Egg Beater, No Handle
![](./media/image20.png){width=40%}


This is like a 4-person version of a synchronous double weave.


| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | C       |         | D       |         |
| **B**       | D       |         | C       |         |
| **C**       | A       |         | B       |         |
| **D**       | B       |         | A       |         |


After the 4th beat, the jugglers are inverted, but the passing sequence repeats.

This pattern dates to 1997 by Mike Newton and MAJ.

### Cockeyed Apollo

Change the outside throws to be in a Y and the Apollo becomes cockeyed...so
named because the middle feeder (B) has to throw and catch from opposite
directions.

The Electric Razor is 3 pairs of jugglers. Each pair moves around their own circle.

The numbers in the table above count passes.

The Electric Razor pattern was invented by Peter Kaseman, summer '98.



### Ball-Bearing
![](./media/image82.png){width=30%}

A, B, C, and D are doing a Feast (in 4-count), but the self throw is replaced
with a pass to one of the movers in the middle. A, B, C, and D are passing
4-count. E and F are passing 8-count.

### Stick on the End Double Weave (Synchronous)

Two teams of weavers pass to each other while weaving: moving back on the ends,
forward in the middle. Pass straight across from whatever position you are in.
"Synchronous" means everyone passes at the same time. In order for this to work,
pass twice while in the end positions, and pass once while in the middle.
Weavers pass in 6-count in the standard version, but since they're in sync you can
easily do other counts. 4-count is pretty tough, but 5-count is fun!

### Spiral

Peter and Luke have complained that this shouldn't be called a Spiral, but that's what we call it! It's sort
of a weave, but there are three loops instead of two. And you pass at the faces of the loops instead of on the edges.

## Eight


## Polymer Weave

It's a passing axiom that any 2-count feeder can be replaced by a standard weave. If this
is applied to the traditional W pattern, the result is this crazy pattern. It is
called a Polymer Weave because you can add additional weaves to either end of
the pattern (just like adding additional passers to a W).

## Benzene Ring (for 8 Jugglers)
![](./media/image110.jpeg){width=50%}

Here's another MAJ standard. E and F are carriage return feeders, feeding to 3
positions: left, middle, right, left, middle, right, etc. The rest of the
jugglers move around in a ring, passing to the feeders. They pass 3 times to
each feeder and then turn around to pass 3 times to the next feeder.

The feeders G and H feed carriage return to 4 positions (instead of 3 positions
in the 6 juggler version). The movers move around the loop passing to each
feeder 4 times before turning around to pass to the other feeder. The graph
shows half of a full cycle. The pattern will repeat in its mirror image.

## Weaving Canoes
![](./media/image113.png){width=50%}

This pattern is a cross between the Asynchronous Double Weave and the Canoe. The
Canoe for 3 jugglers is commonly referred to as a drop-back line. We recommend
that you can do these before trying the Weaving Canoes.

A, D, and G start the pattern with the first pass as indicated in the passing
graph above. After they pass, they move to the right of their respective weaves.
Meanwhile, B, E, and H make their first pass on the second passing beat, and
then weave to the left, replacing A, D, and G. C, F, and I pass on the 3rd
passing beat and weave to the left.

## Double Gandini 5 Weave

Two mirrored Gandini 5 Weaves face each other and pass in 2-count (or any other
count).

Weavers go in alternate directions. It is easiest if both weavers go the same
direction (for example A and F start to the pattern's right and B and G start to
the pattern's left).

If this is too fast, then pass twice in the middle (either to the same weaver or
to two different feeders).

## Mr. Inside-Mr. Outside Weave
![](./media/image36.png){width=50%}

This modifies the standard weave by  dividing the feeder into two feeders (one
passing on the inside and one on the outside), both on 4-count in the standard version.
It's  a good warm up pattern
for the Twister Weave (see below).

| **Juggler/beat** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | C       |         | E       |         | D       |         |
| **B**       |         | D       |         | C       |         | E       |
| **C**       | A       |         |         | B       |         |         |
| **D**       |         | B       |         |         | A       |         |
| **E**       |         |         | A       |         |         | B       |

> * Right hand counting

Juggler A is also called Glen Davis (Mr. Outside), and Juggler B is Doc Blanchard (Mr. Inside), for
reasons that none of us recall, though Tom Pomraning insisted on the names.  Movements of
the weavers are identical to the Standard Weave, though passes go alternatively to the two
feeders.

![](./media/image37.png){width=50%}

The same variations for the standard weave and the Twister Weave can be used for
this pattern, but there are some others. For example, Jugglers A and B can set up on a line
perpendicular to the weave, with A (outside) further from the weave.

When was this pattern created? We have been doing it since 1994.



### Twister Popcorn

The Twister Popcorn is the same as the Popcorn Feed except there are 2 feeders,
one on each side, and each popcorn feedee passes to one, turns to pass to the
other, and repeats. The feedees do not weave in this pattern. That's the next
pattern. In this pattern they just turn in place. The feeders do a Typewriter
Feed.

![](./media/image39.jpeg){width=40%}

The hardest position is the middle feedee, because he/she cannot cheat as much
into the turns. You can either turn fast during the single self, throw a right
to left single straight up in the air and do a ½ pirouette underneath it, or
throw a behind the back self to turn.

| **X**       | D-A   |       | D-C   |       | D-B   |       |

| **A**       |T-self | D-X   |       |T-self | D-Y   |       |
| **B**       |       |T-self | D-Y   |       |T-self | D-X   |
| **C**       | D-Y   |       |T-self | D-    |       |T-self |

> * Right hands counting
> * X and C start with 4
> * A, B and C are 1 beat after X and Y

It's probably best to be quite comfortable with popcorn feeds before spending a lot of time on this pattern.

## Four Leaf Clover

So the deal with clover patterns is that the number of jugglers is one more than the number of leaves; there's
always one juggler on each leave and one extra in the middle, about to swap places with one of the leaves. This
is a very pleasant 5 person moving pattern; all jugglers do the same thing in the steady state: feed three (right to left); 2-selves to move into middle; pass in middle; 4 selves to get out.  That's a 2-in-4-out, in
contrast to the *2-in-2-out* three-leaf clover for four jugglers.  Each juggler's job repeats after 10, but the
whole pattern takes 40 rights to complete.

another pass on every beat.

## Chocolate Swirl
![](./media/image46.png){width=30%}

The chocolate swirl is a moving extension of Double Chocolate Double Three
Count. It is noteworthy for jugglers moving from one side of the pattern to the
other with only a single self throw. That is possible. It is also noteworthy for
being hard, both to remember and to juggle.

The table shows a single transition where E moves to the other side.

B and C do sweep feeds of 3 feedees each.

D and G do 4-count between A and the feeder on their side (B and C respectively)

E and F do a sweep feed with a phantom (don't pass to the phantom).

## Eye of the Needle

A Twister Weave has lots of time and space in the middle.

If your weavers are quite comfortable with outside turns in a Twister Weave,
then here is a fun and good looking pattern. This is just a Twister Weave with
another passing duo embedded in the center.

> * Right hand counting

If this pattern is too challenging as written, then start by skipping the passes
from M and N to X. Then M and N just do a 4-count in the middle and X does a
standard Mr. Outside 4-count.

There are a number of patterns that have enough room to embed other patterns in
the middle.

> * Right hand counting

See all those selves? Once you're comfortable with this pattern, make life more
interesting by adding extra passes in the selves. One variation is for F and G
to pick up the passes before and after their normal passes (so they throw pass,
pass, pass, self). Another variation is for each E, F and G to all pass twice in
a row to the weavers. D can't pass twice in a row without making the turn from D
to E rather difficult.
