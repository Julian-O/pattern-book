### Cockeyed Apollo

Change the outside throws to be in a Y and the Apollo becomes cockeyed...so
named because the middle feeder (B) has to throw and catch from opposite
directions.

The Electric Razor is 3 pairs of jugglers. Each pair moves around their own circle.

The numbers in the table above count passes.

The Electric Razor pattern was invented by Peter Kaseman, summer '98.



### Ball-Bearing

A, B, C, and D are doing a Feast (in 4-count), but the self throw is replaced
with a pass to one of the movers in the middle. A, B, C, and D are passing
4-count. E and F are passing 8-count.

### Stick on the End Double Weave (Synchronous)

Two teams of weavers pass to each other while weaving: moving back on the ends,
forward in the middle. Pass straight across from whatever position you are in.
"Synchronous" means everyone passes at the same time. In order for this to work,
pass twice while in the end positions, and pass once while in the middle.
Weavers pass in 6-count in the standard version, but since they're in sync you can
easily do other counts. 4-count is pretty tough, but 5-count is fun!

### Spiral

Peter and Luke have complained that this shouldn't be called a Spiral, but that's what we call it! It's sort
of a weave, but there are three loops instead of two. And you pass at the faces of the loops instead of on the edges.

## Eight


## Polymer Weave

It's a passing axiom that any 2-count feeder can be replaced by a standard weave. If this
is applied to the traditional W pattern, the result is this crazy pattern. It is
called a Polymer Weave because you can add additional weaves to either end of
the pattern (just like adding additional passers to a W).

## Benzene Ring (for 8 Jugglers)
![](./media/image110.jpeg){width=50%}

Here's another MAJ standard. E and F are carriage return feeders, feeding to 3
positions: left, middle, right, left, middle, right, etc. The rest of the
jugglers move around in a ring, passing to the feeders. They pass 3 times to
each feeder and then turn around to pass 3 times to the next feeder.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **10** | **11** | **12** |

> * Right hand counting

The feeders G and H feed carriage return to 4 positions (instead of 3 positions
in the 6 juggler version). The movers move around the loop passing to each
feeder 4 times before turning around to pass to the other feeder. The graph
shows half of a full cycle. The pattern will repeat in its mirror image.

## Weaving Canoes
![](./media/image113.png){width=50%}

This pattern is a cross between the Asynchronous Double Weave and the Canoe. The
Canoe for 3 jugglers is commonly referred to as a drop-back line. We recommend
that you can do these before trying the Weaving Canoes.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** |

| **A**       | D     |       |       |
| **B**       |       | E     |       |

A, D, and G start the pattern with the first pass as indicated in the passing
graph above. After they pass, they move to the right of their respective weaves.
Meanwhile, B, E, and H make their first pass on the second passing beat, and
then weave to the left, replacing A, D, and G. C, F, and I pass on the 3rd
passing beat and weave to the left.

## Double Gandini 5 Weave

Two mirrored Gandini 5 Weaves face each other and pass in 2-count (or any other
count).

Weavers go in alternate directions. It is easiest if both weavers go the same
direction (for example A and F start to the pattern's right and B and G start to
the pattern's left).

If this is too fast, then pass twice in the middle (either to the same weaver or
to two different feeders).
