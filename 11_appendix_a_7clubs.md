Appendix A â€“ 7 club patterns
============================

Peter Kaseman and I had an experiment in winter 1999 to think up how many 7 club patterns we could do. The goal was 100, and at first we thought that would be a difficult target. However we soon realized that there are so many possible site swap variations and tempo changes that we easily passed 100. Not of all of them are easy to actually juggle though! Here are a few of the ideas we explored. (Also see Appendices D and E for some more ideas.)

**Chocolate Bars **

4px4px33 | 3p3p44

A: crossing double pass right, crossing double pass left, self, self.

B: straight single pass right, straight single pass left, straight double self, straight double self (starts with 4)

4p4p33 | 3px3px33

A: straight double pass right, straight double pass left, self, self.

B: crossing single pass left, crossing single pass left, straight double self, straight double self (starts with 4)

4p4p33 | 33px5px3

A: straight double pass right, straight double pass left, self, self.

B: self, crossing single pass right, crossing triple pass left, self

4px4px33 | 33p5p3

A: crossing double right, crossing double left, self, self.

B: right self, straight single pass left, straight triple pass right, self, self.

**4-count variations**

Here's a nice variation on 4-count triples in 7.

5p333533p3 | 335p33533p

In right hand counting: triple pass, single self, triple self, single pass.

**Pass, Pass, Shuffle**

5px5px1 | 4p4p1 (2<sup>nd</sup> juggler starts on beat 2)

A: triple cross, triple cross, shuffle.

B: pause, double straight, triple cross, shuffle.

**Another 6-count**

5p33334 | 3345p33

Crossing triple right, self, self, self, self, straight self double left

**Paired Siteswap Passing Patterns**

Any two siteswaps can be turned into passing patterns. For example, consider the 4 club siteswap 534 and the trivial 3 club siteswap 333. There are 12 different passing patterns from combining these two siteswaps. The juggler with the 534 can pass the 5, or the 3, or the 4, or the 5 and 3, 5 and 4, 4 and 3 or all of them. The juggler juggling the 3's just has to throw 1, 2 or 3 passes to match the timing of the first juggler. Then, we can switch all the straights to crosses and the crosses to straights to generate 6 more patterns (although 3 of them don't actually work because the two 3's collide if they are both crossing).

5p34 | 333p

53p4 | 33p3

534p | 3p33 (second juggler starts with 4)

5p3p4 | 33p3p

5p34p | 3p33p (second juggler starts with 4)

5p3p4p | 3p3p3p (second juggler starts with 4)

Crossing versions that work include:

5px34 | 333px

534px | 3px33 (second juggler starts with 4)

5px34px | 3px33px (second juggler starts with 4)

The same idea can be extended to any set of siteswaps with any number of items, such as 561 against 531 or 7441 against 7531. The simple siteswap 444 | 333 has a lot of nice passing variations. More complex siteswaps get challenging very quickly, though.

If the two jugglers have different numbers of clubs (for example 444 | 333), then they can switch sides with each other at almost any point by the first juggler throwing two passes in a row.

There is also a dual passing pattern variation of each of the above, as described in Appendix B.

**Popcorns**

4-count: 3p353 | 533p3

5-count: 3.5p 3353 | 53 3.5p 33 (slight pause for 2<sup>nd</sup> juggler)

6-count: 4p33353 | 3534p33 (juggler 2 starts with left on these 6-count popcorn)

or 4p33344 | 3444p33 or 4p44144 | 1444p44 (skip 1 on start)

or 4p53153 | 1534p553 (skip 1 on start)

7-count: 4.5p 333353 | 353 4.5p 333

All even counted popcorns can also be juggled left-handed or with all crossing passes (one juggler left handed and the other right handed).

Now, to make things more interesting, all the popcorns can be juggled against either the next or previous versions in fast/slow. One juggler juggles fast, and the other slowly, so that they each complete a cycle at the same time. The odd count juggler always throws to the same side with alternating left and right passes (also alternating straight and cross passes). The even count juggler throws to each side in turn, also alternating straight and cross passes.

Try 7 club 1-count against 2-count, 2-count against 3-count, 3-count against 4-count, 4-count against 5-count, 5-count against 6-count and 6-count against 7-count.

All of the above patterns have Dual Passing Pattern variations, which tend to have a lot of ultimate single passes and some challenging synchronous variations. Try some and see.

4px5p3p4px5p3px | 3p3p3p3p3p3p (2<sup>nd</sup> juggler starts with 4)

4px33p3p4px4px | 3p4px4px4px33p (2<sup>nd</sup> juggler starts with 4)

4px33p3p | 3p4px53p

**Three Up**

Three Up is a 7 club 8 count popcorn pattern based on the 5551 siteswap with 4 clubs that Peter brought back from somewhere. As an incoming pass comes in, flash 3 crossing doubles (555), catch the incoming club, shuffle it from left to right and then pass it back as a single pass.

55513p333 | 3p3335551

It's technically possible to juggle this pattern with 8 clubs as 55514px | 4p5551 (the fives are doubles and the four is a single) but that's tough.

The 7-club version is more reasonable, and allows opportunity to play with all kinds of 4 club siteswaps. Try replacing the 5551 with 7441, 6631, 7531 and 5641.

See some other nice 7 club synchronous patterns in Appendices D and E.
