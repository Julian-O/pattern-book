On April 17/22, we ran eggbeater with colors through 70 beats [I balked at 70, needed 72 to get full cycle]!
We also did a first run of 345 eggbeater with colors, and Nathan worked out some interesting loop structure

Jan 2023, just after  Madfest.
We did the Hex of clovers for the big pattern...pretty fun with Chad on drums and getting our rhythms right.
It was a challenging pattern to set up, especially with me mixing up 6 and 8 counts!

at the fest, we also did a post feeding a 2pi/3, and with the addition of triples over the top between the post and
someone on the back side (Tom from Minneapolis).

we also did a fully-loaded broken hearted blast...pretty cool...several options for where to put the middle extra
person; we tried way outside the pattern, but I think we could also do it with him facing the same direction, offset
by 6 ft or so, as the two primary feeders.   It looks to me almost like a site-swap pattern, and might be the
basis of another big pattern
