Takes 72 passing beats to return to starting state
The handle only touches 6 out of the 15 clubs
Made possible by the 2 6-count passes each beater person does (In passing counts that are multiples of 3, the club you catch is the club you throw next) 
The other 9 clubs are shifted around the beaters
As such, there are 2 closed circuits of clubs
Handle circuit which has a period of 24 passing beats
Beater circuit which has a period of 72 passing beats

Another interesting point: Andy (the handle) doesn't touch any of Mark's clubs.
